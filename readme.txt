Add a Google-like scheduler to your WordPress site

== Description ==

**[mormat_scheduler]** is a shortcode that render an event scheduler component. The purpose was to provide an alternative to Google's scheduler.

The scheduler offers three calendar views : `day`, `week` or `month`. 

Events can be created, edited and deleted directly from the scheduler (which can be done by logged in users only).

Drag and drop is also available.

= Shortcode parameters =
- **height** : Define the height of the scheduler. It must be a css compatible value (for instance "640px" or "70vh"). 
- **initial_date** : A date from which the scheduler will start displaying the events. If not provided, the current date system will be used. A string formatted as "yyyy-mm-dd" can be provided or any value compatible with the `Date` javascript object. 
- **default_view**: The default view used for displaying events. Allowed values are "day", "week" or "month". Default value is "week"
- **events_namespace**: Useful only if you need to display and manage a specific set of events. The default value is "".
